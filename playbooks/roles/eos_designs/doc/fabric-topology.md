# Fabric Topology Variables

The fabric topology variables define the connectivity between the various node types, as well as override the default switch properties.

</div>

As per the diagram above, the topology hierarchy is the following:

fabric_name > dc_name > pod_name

- Fabric Name, required to match Ansible Group name covering all devices in the Fabric | Required and **must** be an inventory group name.

```yaml
fabric_name: < Fabric_Name >
```

- DC Name, required to match Ansible Group name covering all devices in the DC | Required for 5-stage CLOS (Super-spines)

```yaml
dc_name: < DC_Name >
```

- POD Name, only used in Fabric Documentation | Optional, fallback to dc_name and then to fabric_name. Recommended to be common between Spines, Leafs within a POD (One l3ls topology)

```yaml
pod_name: < POD_Name >
```

- Connectivity is defined from the child's device perspective.
  - Source uplink interfaces and parent interfaces are defined on the child.
- A static unique identifier (id) is assigned to each device.
  - This is leveraged to derive the IP address assignment from each summary defined in the Fabric Underlay and Overlay Topology Variables.
- Within the l3_leaf and l2_leaf dictionary variables, defaults can be defined.
  - This reduces user input requirements, limiting errors.
  - The default variables can be overridden when defined under the node groups.

## Supported designs

`eos_designs` supports multiple flavors of L3LS-EVPN topology such as 3-stage CLOS and 5-stage CLOS. Sections below highlight these 2 topologies, but you can extend `eos_designs` to support your own topology by using [`node_type_keys`](node-types.html) to create your own node type

### 3-stage CLOS Topology Support (Leaf & Spine)

- The **eos_designs** role support various deployments with layer 3 leaf and spine (3-stage CLOS) and optionally, with dedicated overlay controllers.
- 3 stage CLOS fabric can be represented as spines, L3 leafs and L2 leafs, and also referred to as a "POD".

### 5-stage CLOS Topology Support (Super Spine)

- The **eos_designs** role support lager deployments with super-spines (5-stage CLOS) and optionally, with dedicated overlay controllers.
- 5 stage CLOS fabric can be represented as multiple leaf-spine structures (called PODs - Point of Delivery) interconnected by super-spines.
- The logic to deploy every leaf-spine POD fabric remains unchanged.
- Super-spines can be deployed as a single plane (typically chassis switches) or multiple planes.

## Node Type Variables

The following table provide information on the default node types that have been pre-defined in [`eos_designs/defaults/main/defaults-node-type-keys.yml`](https://github.com/aristanetworks/ansible-avd/tree/devel/ansible_collections/arista/avd/roles/eos_designs/defaults). To customize or create new node types, please refer to [node types definition](node-types.md)

| Node Type Key      | Underlay Router | Uplink Type | Default EVPN Role  | L2 Network Services | L3 Network Services | VTEP | MLAG Support | Connected Endpoints |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| super_spine        | ✅              | p2p          | none              | ✘                  | ✘                   | ✘   | ✘            | ✘                  |
| spine              | ✅              | p2p          | server            | ✘                  | ✘                   | ✘   | ✘            | ✘                  |
| l3leaf             | ✅              | p2p          | client            | ✅                 | ✅                  | ✅  | ✅           | ✅                 |
| l2leaf             | ✘               | port-channel | none              | ✅                 | ✘                   | ✘   | ✅           | ✅                 |
| overlay_controller | ✅              | p2p          | server            | ✘                  | ✘                   | ✘   | ✘            | ✘                  |

The variables should be applied to all devices in the fabric.

- The `type:` variable needs to be defined for each device in the fabric.
- This is leveraged to load the appropriate template to generate the configuration.

### Variables and Options

As explained above, you can defined your own types of devices. CLI only provides default node types.

```yaml
# define the layer type
type: < spine | l3leaf | l2leaf | super-spine | overlay-controller >
```

### Example

```yaml
# Defined in SPINE.yml file
# Can also be set directly in your inventory file under spine group
type: spine

# Defined in L3LEAFS.yml
# Can also be set directly in your inventory file under l3leaf group
type: l3leaf

# Defined in L2LEAFS.yml
# Can also be set directly in your inventory file under l2leaf group
type: l2leaf

# Defined in SUPER-SPINES.yml
# Can also be set directly in your inventory file under super-spine group
type: super-spine

# Defined in ROUTE-SERVERS.yml
# Can also be set directly in your inventory file under route-server group
type: overlay-controller
```

All node types have the same structure based on `defaults`, `node_group`, `node` and all variables can be defined in any section and support inheritance like this:

Under `node_type_key:`

```bash
defaults <- node_group <- node_group.node <- node
```

## Node type structure

```yaml
---
<node_type_key>:
  defaults:
    # Define vars for all nodes of this type
  node_groups:
    <node group name>:
    # Vars related to all nodes part of this group
      nodes:
        <node inventory hostname>:
          # Vars defined per node
  nodes:
    <node inventory hostname>:
      # Vars defined per node

      # Unique identifier | Required.
      id: < integer >

      # Node management IP address | Optional.
